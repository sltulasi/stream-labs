1. How long did it take you to complete this assignment?

    6 hours


2. What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
   
   Building dynamic layouts for adding more sources and streams.


3. What about this assignment did you find unclear?
   
   Icons for selected stream is not given in the design.


4. What challenges did you face that you did not expect?
   
   I have not faced any challenges for this requirement. I guess, it might be more challenging to build ui for multiple real time streams.


5. Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?
   
   Yes, this is at appropriate for 5 hour assessment.


6. Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.
   
   1. Vuejs - Vuejs is relatively easy to learn, more readable compare to other javascript frameworks. Also, have edge on performance. Personally, I picked vuejs for it simplicity, easy to use for any size projects.
   
   2. Tailwind - I used this for its utility-first CSS framework, so I can spend little/no-time writing css.
   

7. Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.

   I have made certain assumptions based up general ui/ux practices like button highlight when hover. However, in real time scenarios I would ask ux designer to provide mockups for any missing ui.
